    "## I. Purpose and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes marathon pace strategy using data scraped from the 2021 Boston Marathon results. For purposes of this project, \"pace strategy\" can generally be broken down into three types that will be referred to throughout this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Even pacing\" refers to running the second half of the race about as fast as the first half.\n",
    "* \"Positive splits\" refers to running the second half of the race slower than the first half.\n",
    "* \"Negative splits\" refers to running the second half of the race faster than the first half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has generally found differences in marathon pacing for runners of different ability levels, but has been mixed on differences in marathon pacing for runners of different genders. Jared Ward, an American runner who placed 6th in the 2016 Olympic Marathon, also wrote a masters thesis on marathon pace strategy. He analyzed split times for runners in the 2013 St. George Marathon. He found that elite runners tend to run more evenly paced races than non-elite runners, who tend to slow more in the second half of the race. He also found that women tend to run more evenly paced races than men, but elite men and women run more similarly to each other [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Alejandro Santos-Lozano et al. studied finishers of the New York Marathon from 2006 to 2011 to examine the impact of ability level and gender on marathon pacing. They found that all runners tend to adopt a positive splits strategy, but that faster runners tend to run more evenly paced races regardless of gender. However, they didn't find significant differences between men and women [2]. Daniel March et al. studied runners in the Last Chance Marathon in Dublin, OH from 2005 to 2007. They found that women and faster runners tend to run more evenly paced races than men and slower runners respectively. However, they did not find any statistically significant interactions between gender and runner ability [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is also worth noting that four of the last six marathon world records and the two fastest (official) marathons ever run were all actually run with a negative splits strategy, though still fairly close to even pacing [4-5].\n",
    "\n",
    "This project attempts to answer the following questions for runners age 18-39 who finished the 2021 Boston Marathon in less than 5 hours:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there any relationship between marathon finish time and pace strategy?\n",
    "2. Is there any relationship between a runner's gender and their marathon pace strategy?\n",
    "3. Does the relationship of marathon finish time to pace strategy depend on a runner's gender, or does the relationship of gender to pace strategy depend on a runner's finish time?\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Data and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project comes from the [2021 Boston Marathon results](https://boston.r.mikatiming.com/2021/?pid=leaderboard&pidp=leaderboard) on the Boston Athletic Association website. The data was scraped using the scrapy library for Python. The code for the scraper is included in the [marathon_scraper](https://github.com/tommcd09/marathon-pace-strategy/tree/main/marathon_scraper) folder of this project. Unfortunately, the BAA does not allow publishing or reposting Boston Marathon results without expressed written consent from the BAA, so the data is not reproduced with this project. However, the data can be obtained and viewed directly from the BAA website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>place_overall:</b> The runner's overall placing in the race.\n",
    "* <b>place_gender:</b> The runner's placing within their gender\n",
    "* <b>place_division:</b> The runner's placing within their age and gender group.\n",
    "* <b>sex:</b> The runner's gender. Relabeled \"gender\" during cleaning.\n",
    "* <b>age_group:</b> An integer representing the runner's age group. These integers were encoded in the URLs of marathon results pages and were used both to crawl through the results and to label the age groups. The numbers map to the following age groups: 1 = 18-39, 2 = 40-44, 9 = 45-49, 3 = 50-54, 10 = 55-59, 4 = 60-64, 11 = 65-69, 8 = 70-74, 12 = 75-79, 13 = 80+.\n",
    "* <b>name:</b> The runner's first name, last name, and three letter country code.\n",
    "* <b>bib:</b> The runner's unique bib number. Relabeled \"runner_id\" during cleaning.\n",
    "* <b>half_split:</b> The runner's time for the first half of the marathon. Relabeled \"first_half\" during cleaning.\n",
    "* <b>finish_net:</b> The runner's finish time measured from the time they crossed the starting line to the time they crossed the finish line. Relabeled \"finish\" during cleaning.\n",
    "* <b>finish_gun:</b> The runner's finish time measured from the time of the starting gun to the time they crossed the finish line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that this data is not representative of marathon runners generally. The Boston Marathon is a special race among marathons--runners must meet tough qualifying standards or raise large amounts of money for charity to qualify to run. This data also represents runners on a particular course on a particular day with particular weather, all factors which could reduce the randomness of the data. Thus, we should be careful about generalizing the results of this project beyond the 2021 Boston Marathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was cleaned in a separate [cleaning](https://github.com/tommcd09/marathon-pace-strategy/blob/main/cleaning.ipynb) notebook and explored in a separate [exploratory_data_analysis](https://github.com/tommcd09/marathon-pace-strategy/blob/main/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) notebook. To analyze the data, this project uses a 2x2 factorial ANOVA to compare the mean difference in first and second half splits as a percentage of overall finish time for different groups of runners based on gender and ability level. Negative split difference percentages represent a negative splits strategy for a particular runner, while a positive split difference represents a positive splits strategy. A split difference of 0 or close to 0 represents even pacing. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the big advantages of using a factorial design is that it allows for testing whether there is an interaction between the effects of gender and ability level [6]. However, a few assumptions [7] must be satisfied in order for ANOVA to be an appropriate method for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The distribution of the y variable (i.e., split difference) is normal within each group.\n",
    "2. Each data point is independent and randomly sampled.\n",
    "3. There is homogeneity of variance between each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "And while it isn't a formal assumption, extreme outliers can also influence the results of an ANOVA [8]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis revealed that while the data is approximately normally distributed for each group, it is not perfectly so. It also revealed that there might be issues with homogeneity of variance between groups. The following analysis will examine each ANOVA assumption in detail before looking at the ANOVA results.\n",

This will be done with a custom experiment_groups function."

    "\n",
    "One of the assumptions of ANOVA is that the distribution of the y variable (i.e., split difference) is normal within each group [7]. One way to assess normality is with formal tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test. However, Shapiro-Wilk is more appropriate for smaller sample sizes [9], so it is not a good option here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful way to assess normality is to look at a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of the residuals for each group. A Q-Q plot plots theoretical quantiles from a distribution against sample quantiles from the data. If both sets of quantiles come from the same distribution, the points should conform to a straight line, represented here in red [10]."

    "A normal distribution would have a skew of 0 and kurtosis of 3, so these values are not huge departures from normality. Moreover, ANOVA is generally robust to departures from the assumption of normality. That is, the actual Type I error rate is still very close to the chosen significance level even when the data is non-normal, though less so with unequal sample sizes [6]. Thus, we will consider the assumption satisfied.\n",

    "#### B. Independence and random sampling\n",

    "The second assumption is that each data point is independent and each sample was collected using random sampling [7]. In this project, the first part is easily satisfied. As for the second part, while this project has randomly sampled from runners 18-39 in the Boston Marathon who ran under 5 hours, we noted in the introduction that we could reasonably question whether Boston Marathon runners represent a random sample of marathon runners as a whole. If we were to look at several years of results from the Boston Marathon, or aggregated results of several marathons, that might produce something closer to a random sample of all marathon runners. However, at least with respect to the 2021 Boston Marathon, we will consider this assumption satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Homogeneity of Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The last assumption is homogeneity of variance between each group [7]. We already saw earlier that the variances of the groups were not the same. This can also be visualized by plotting the fitted values of the OLS model against the residuals."

    "We can see that the largest variance is 30.06 and the smallest is 8.80, which means the ratio is less than 4. So, we are probably okay proceeding with the ANOVA. If we were still concerned about homogeneity of variance, one option would be to fit a weighted least squares (WLS) model to the data instead of an ordinary least squares (OLS) model [11]. This would essentially assign weights to the data points when fitting the model. As an extra, an alternative analysis using weighted least squares has been included at the end of this notebook. The results of the weighted least squares analysis are not significantly different than the ordinary least squares analysis, indicating that the ordinary least squares analysis is indeed robust to any heterogeneity of variance here.\n",

    "#### D. Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "While it isn't a formal assumption, we should consider whether any particular data points might be influencing the results of the test. There are many ways that outliers get defined in research [12], but for our purposes we can think of outliers as being guess values that are extremely large or small compared to the rest of the data. There are multiple ways to identify outliers [12-13], but one way that would work well for this experiment is to use the Tukey box plot method. We define an inner fence at 1.5 times the interquartile range on the upper and lower ends of the data and an outer fence at 3 times the interquartile range on the upper and lower ends. Any points between the inner and outer fences are considered \"possible outliers\" and any points beyond the outer fence are considered \"probable outliers\". Some of the advantages of this test are that it is relatively robust to outliers (i.e., finding one outlier is independent of other outliers) and that it does not require a normal distribution of data [13]. We will use a function from a wonderful [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-and-treating-outliers-in-python-part-1-4ece5098b755) by Alicia Horsch to perform this task [13]."

    "Once outliers are identified, we could, among other things [12], keep them [12,14], drop them [12,14], recode them with a different value [12,14], transform our data to reduce their impact [8,12,15], or use a different method or model to analyze the data that is more robust to outliers [8,12,15]. As a general rule, we should not drop or alter outliers without a good objective reason, and we should not drop or alter them simply because they do not fit the general trend of our data [16]. In fact, outliers might contain interesting and useful knowledge about the phenomenon being studied [12]. If we could show that any outliers were actually the result of error, or are not a part of the population of interest in our experiment, that would be a good reason to drop or alter them [12,16]. So, let's look more closely at the outliers. First, the probable outliers:"

    "These are both women running about 4.5 hour times who ran a significantly slower second half than first half. We don't have enough information to determine if there was a measurement or data entry error, so we must assume the times are all correct. A time of around three hours for the second half split corresponds to an average speed of about 4.37 mph, or about 13:44/mile. It's possible that these runners walked significant portions of the second half, especially if they ran the first half in well under two hours, but we cannot be certain of that. It's entirely plausible that they simply ran the whole race, but did the first half too fast and had to slow down for the second half, which would make them still of interest for this project. Thus, the safest thing to do would be to keep them in the experiment as is.\n",

However, we should further run a simple effects analysis to get a better idea of how significant BQ and gender are individually. To do this we will run a series of one-way ANOVAs, first holding gender constant and looking at the significance of BQ, then holding BQ constant and looking at the significance of gender."

    "### 6. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that running a fast time in the 2021 Boston Marathon was related to running a much more evenly paced race. One possible explanation for this is that faster runners have better coaching and are thinking more about their strategy [1]. Assuming that better coaching leads to better training, then runners who are better coached are likely to both be faster (leading to faster finish times) and more resistant to fatigue (leading to less slowing in the second half of the race). Faster runners also might have run more previous marathons, which might give them a more realistic sense of their own pace and which pacing strategies work better. So, it's possible that experience and coaching, rather than finish time itself, is the true determinant of pacing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a much smaller but still statistically significant effect of gender on runners who did not run a Boston Marathon qualifying time. Women tended to run more evenly paced races, at least among the non-BQ runners. One possible explanation for this is that there is evidence that women have some natural advantages when it comes to distance running. Women have a lower respiratory exchange ratio during endurance exercise compared to similarly trained men, leading to using proportionately more fat and less carbohydrate at a given relative intensity. This could delay the onset of glycogen depletion, which can cause marathon runners to \"hit the wall\" and slow down late in the race [3]. This might also explain why there isn't a statistically significant difference between BQ men and BQ women. Top runners generally have better running economy, which could delay glycogen depletion and overheating and thus reduce the risk of slowing down [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project performed a 2x2 factorial ANOVA to compare the effects of gender and ability level on pace strategy, expressed as the difference between the second and first half splits as a percentage of overall finish time, for runners age 18-39 who finished the 2021 Boston Marathon faster than five hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA revealed that there was a statistically significant interaction between the effects of gender and running a Boston qualifying time (F(1, 3940) = 16.17, p = 0.00).\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple main effects analysis showed that running a Boston qualifying time had a statistically significant effect on split difference for both men (p = 0.00) and women (p = 0.00). The effect sizes of running a Boston qualifying time on men and women were 1.13 and 1.04 standard deviations, respectively. That is, men and women who ran BQ times ran split differences that were 1.13 and 1.04 standard deviations lower respectively than men and women who didn't run BQ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple main effects analysis showed that gender did not have a statistically significant effect on split difference for runners who ran a Boston qualifying time (p = 0.08), but did have a statistically significant effect for runners who did not run a Boston qualifying time (p = 0.00). The effect size of being male on runners who did not run a Boston qualifying time was 0.26 standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major limitation of this project is the uniqueness of both the Boston Marathon in general and the 2021 Boston Marathon in particular. A larger amount of data, either from more runnings of the Boston Marathon or from a wider cross-section of marathons, would help to determine whether these results hold up generally across all marathons. Another major limitation of this project is looking only at runner age 18-39. An interesting follow up to this experiment would be to run a similar experiment on a larger selection of data and also examine the effects of age on pace strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## V. EXTRA: Weighted Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where we might question whether we have enough homogeneity of variance to run an ordinary least squares ANOVA, one alternative option is running a weighted least squares ANOVA. In weighted least squares, we apply weights to the variances of the residuals to balance out differences in variance between groups. Because we know the residuals of the ordinary least squares model, we can compute weights for each group of residuals that are equal to 1/var(resids_i) for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4, where resids_i is the set of residuals for each group in the experiment [11].\n",
